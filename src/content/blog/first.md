This is the first post on my website! I don't really know yet what I will write on here, but I am excited.
I think I'm gonna share some technical things on here and just do some casual posts.
I take the occasion though, to talk a bit about

## My current gear

I currently use a **Canon EOS 600D** I bought second-hand from an swiss second-hand store. It works excellently and I don't really have plans to upgrade at the moment. It has a 18MP APS-C sensor and a decently well burst mode, which is important for me since I do a lot of rowing photography. The only thing I currently dislike about this camera is the "Live View"-Mode and the Video functionality. It is of course not the best since it is a quite older camera, but
I'd like to have those things.

Let's talk about lenses. To be honest, for the longest time I've been using the kit lens **Canon EF-S 18-55mm F/3.5-5.6 IS II**. I was happy with this lens, shot a few portraits, but it wasn't enough. So I recently picked up the **Canon EF 24-105mm F/3.5-5.6 IS STM**. I really like this lens, because it has a focal range from wide to tele. That meant that I could now do rowing photography to some extent without having to borrow lenses from friends. I think that this lens was a very good investment for all sorts of ranges of things I like to take pictures of.

## Gear I plan to obtain

Let's regard this as kind of a wishlist. But fact is, that even for rowing photography I'd like to have a more tele lens. I strongly believe in the principle, that you shouldn't buy new gear all the time but make the best out of the things you have. And I also do that. That's also why I've used the kit lens for such a long time.

But I'd like to have a lens that goes more in this sweet telephoto direction. There are a few options I take into consideration:

1. **Canon EF 70-300mm F/4.0-5.6 IS II USM**
2. **SIGMA Contemporary 150-600mm F/5.0-6.3 DG OS HSM**

Both are excellent lenses I've heard great stuff about. One of my photography friends own the Sigma one and it shoots great images. I also thought about getting something in the 100-400mm focal range, but one of these is a better fit in my opinion.
The Canon lens is great for rowing photography over all I think so to get a more wide shot of the boats. For more detailed shots I will eventually upgrade for the Sigma one. Both lenses are currently on my watch list and I am constantly looking out for bang for the buck offers. There is a slight telephoto-dilemma I want to address in a future post though.

Regarding camera bodies, I took the **Canon EOS R8** and the **Canon EOS R6 Mark II** into consideration. They both have the same processor and the same 24.20MP sensor, but the R6 is bigger and has IBIS and a faster burst mode and some other perks. I'll definitely buy an EF-RF lens adapter for the camera, since I plan to keep the lenses I will have 'til then.

So yeah. This is a little summary and my thoughts about gear. See you soon!
