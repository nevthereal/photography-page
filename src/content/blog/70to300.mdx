For the most part of my photography journey (even back in times where I didn't even have a camera), I wanted a telephoto or telezoom lens. Now I finally got it! And it's amazing!

We are of course talking about the **Canon EF 70-300 F/4-5.6 IS II USM**. It is a lens that I also mentioned in my [previous post](/blog/first), and that I am a big fan of. I think it was a great choice buying this. The "retail" price (if you can even call it like this, since the lens is quite old) here in Switzerland is around 600-700 Swiss Francs, which is about 700-800 US Dollars. I picked it up on a Swiss second-hand online shop for 250 Swiss Francs, so about 300 USD. Now that I call a steal. I am so proud I picked this up. And let me tell you: it is a pleasure to work with.

It came this morning in the mail, I unpacked it, smacked it on my 600D body and went shooting some stuff in the afternoon. I just went round shooting a bit in the city, like the photo above. I've also gone trainspotting from a bridge, where I took this photo:

It is actually shot through a fence, which you can't make out because it's to close to me. Just a nice detail in my opinion. What immediately stood out for me were a few things:

1. No fringing of colors at the edges of high contrast objects (for example a darker building in front of the bright sky)
2. Really good AF
3. The amazing build quality
4. The weight.

Now, regarding the build quality, I was really blown away by this lens. I didn't expect it to be so high in quality. The plastic feels super good, the switches are snappy and the ring feels nice to turn. I've started with the 18-55mm kit lens. This felt a bit... wanky and it made weird sounds when shaking it. But it was just the cheap kit lens, so I don't blame it. Then I had the 24-105mm, which already felt much better. But this lens just kills it. It just feels so great. The autofocus is also great because of the **Nano USM** motors. The lens is of course a bit heavier, but I guess that's just because of all of the glass and so on.

I didn't shoot any rowing with this lens, but I think it's gonna be just fine. So all in all, **a great lens**. I am very happy with it.
