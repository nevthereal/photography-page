As mentioned in a [previous post](/blog/70to300), I recently acquired the **Canon EF 70-300 f/4-5.6**. This one was definitely a steal.

But I of course had to use it in the place I bought it for. Rowing. And I gotta tell you, it flies. The autofocus is super fast and snappy, the reach incredible and the image quality very good. I got some nice shots multiple angles, you can find my favorites on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/nevillebrem) or in the [gallery](/gallery).

Like I said, I am a huge fan of this lens and pushed it to it's limit last weekend. I really like the autofocus and the range, but one thing I didn't use at all and found really unnecessary is the little LCD-display on top of the lens. I just don't see no point in including or even using it. But suprisingly, the variable aperture isn't as big as a problem as I expected. Rowing is mostly shot in pure daylight so that is not really a problem. I also shoot in Av (aperture priority) mode 95% of the time anyways, so I always get balanced images.

## Being inside of the action

This is one of my favorite shots I took. I could freeze the action so well and
it just feels so dynamic and tense.

## Summary

So that pretty much sums it up for this one. A really banger lens and just a great companion for my use. Would recommend this thing to any photographer looking for a budget lens to get some reach. It is also very good to have such a versatile zoom range. But the aperture makes it a bit hard to use in low light.
